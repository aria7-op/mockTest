    const correctAnswer = `A stack and a queue are both linear data structures but differ in their access patterns:

STACK (LIFO - Last In, First Out):
- Elements are added and removed from the same end (top)
- Operations: push (add), pop (remove), peek (view top)
- Real-world examples: 
  * Browser back button (pages are stacked)
  * Undo functionality in text editors
  * Function call stack in programming
  * Stack of plates in a restaurant

QUEUE (FIFO - First In, First Out):
- Elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front)
- Operations: enqueue (add), dequeue (remove), peek (view front)
- Real-world examples:
  * People waiting in line at a bank
  * Print job queue
  * Task scheduling in operating systems
  * Customer service call queue

Key Differences:
1. Access Pattern: Stack is LIFO, Queue is FIFO
2. Operations: Stack uses push/pop, Queue uses enqueue/dequeue
3. Use Cases: Stack for backtracking/undo, Queue for processing in order
4. Implementation: Stack can be implemented with array or linked list, Queue typically uses linked list for efficiency`;
