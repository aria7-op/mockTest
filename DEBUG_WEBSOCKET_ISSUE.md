# 🔍 WebSocket Notification Debugging Guide

## Issue Summary
Notifications are being sent successfully from the backend, but the frontend is not receiving them via WebSocket.

## ✅ What's Working
- ✅ Backend server running
- ✅ Authentication working  
- ✅ API calls successful
- ✅ Notifications stored in database
- ✅ WebSocket server initialized
- ✅ Socket.IO instance set on notification service

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Test WebSocket Connection Directly

1. **Open the HTML test file:**
   ```bash
   # Open in browser
   open simple_websocket_test.html
   # Or on Linux
   xdg-open simple_websocket_test.html
   ```

2. **Check connection status:**
   - Should show "✅ Connected! Socket ID: xxx"
   - Should show "📤 Joined user room"

3. **Check browser console for:**
   ```javascript
   🔌 WebSocket connected successfully!
   📤 Joined user room
   ```

### Step 2: Check Frontend WebSocket Connection

1. **Open your React frontend at http://localhost:3000**

2. **Login as admin1@mocktest.com**

3. **Open browser dev tools → Console**

4. **Look for these messages:**
   ```javascript
   🔌 Connected to notification server
   Fetch notifications response status: 200
   Fetched notifications data: {...}
   ```

5. **Check Network tab:**
   - Look for WebSocket connection
   - Should show "Status: 101 Switching Protocols"
   - Connection should be persistent

### Step 3: Test Backend WebSocket Emission

1. **Check backend logs when sending notifications:**
   ```bash
   # Look for these in your backend console:
   👤 User joined: cmdw3a9vx0001i2jis7rwwyai
   📨 Notification sent
   ```

2. **Run the notification sender again:**
   ```bash
   node send_live_notifications.js
   ```

3. **Watch backend logs for WebSocket activity**

### Step 4: Frontend WebSocket Debugging

**Check if frontend is properly joining user room:**

1. **Add debug logs to NotificationCenter.jsx:**
   ```javascript
   // In useEffect where WebSocket connects
   socketInstance.on('connect', () => {
     console.log('🔌 Connected to notification server');
     console.log('Socket ID:', socketInstance.id);
   });

   // After emit join-user
   socketInstance.emit('join-user', { userId: user.id });
   console.log('📤 Joining user room for:', user.id);
   ```

2. **Check if user ID matches:**
   - Frontend user ID: Check console log
   - Backend expected ID: `cmdw3a9vx0001i2jis7rwwyai`

### Step 5: Verify Room Joining

**Add this to your frontend NotificationCenter.jsx:**

```javascript
// Add after socketInstance.emit('join-user', { userId: user.id });
socketInstance.on('user-joined', (data) => {
  console.log('✅ Successfully joined user room:', data);
});
```

**Add this to backend server.js in the join-user handler:**

```javascript
socket.on('join-user', (data) => {
  socket.join(`user-${data.userId}`);
  logger.info(`👤 User joined: ${data.userId}`);
  
  // Send confirmation back to client
  socket.emit('user-joined', { 
    userId: data.userId, 
    room: `user-${data.userId}` 
  });
});
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

### When Working Correctly:
1. **Frontend connects:** "🔌 Connected to notification server"
2. **Joins room:** "📤 Joining user room for: cmdw3a9vx0001i2jis7rwwyai"
3. **Room confirmed:** "✅ Successfully joined user room: {...}"
4. **Notifications received:** "🔔 Real-time notification received: {...}"
5. **Badge updates:** Count increases immediately
6. **Toast appears:** Notification slides in from top-right

### Backend Should Log:
```
👤 User joined: cmdw3a9vx0001i2jis7rwwyai
📨 Notification sent
```

## 🔧 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: WebSocket Not Connecting
**Symptoms:** No "Connected to notification server" message
**Fix:** Check CORS settings, restart both servers

### Issue 2: Room Not Joined
**Symptoms:** Connected but no notifications received
**Fix:** Check user ID matching, add room join confirmation

### Issue 3: Proxy Issues
**Symptoms:** WebSocket connection fails
**Fix:** Verify Vite proxy configuration in `vite.config.js`

### Issue 4: User ID Mismatch
**Symptoms:** Room joined but wrong room
**Fix:** Log and compare user IDs between frontend and backend

## 🚀 Quick Fix Commands

```bash
# 1. Restart backend (important!)
npm start

# 2. Restart frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev

# 3. Test WebSocket directly
open simple_websocket_test.html

# 4. Send test notifications
node send_live_notifications.js
```
